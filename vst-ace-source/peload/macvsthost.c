/* System V VST2 as a library, for pehost to dispatch to.
 *
 * Serves two loaders through one driver. A macOS VST2 is a Mach-O bundle loaded
 * by machoload.c; a native Linux VST2 is an ordinary ELF shared object loaded by
 * dlopen. Everything after the entry point is identical, because VST2 on both is
 * plain System V with the same AEffect layout -- so the host callback, the event
 * queue, the render path and the editor are shared rather than duplicated.
 *
 * The macvst_ prefix predates the Linux side; it is kept because renaming forty
 * call sites buys nothing.
 *
 * The CLI in macvst.c proved the path; this is the same sequence behind the
 * interface pehost needs, plus the lock-free event queue that lets the GUI
 * thread send notes while the audio thread renders.
 *
 * No ABI layer: macOS x86-64 is System V, the same convention the host uses, so
 * this runs in-process. That is the whole reason the 32-bit Windows plugins need
 * a helper process and these do not.

/* The embedder half of XEmbed.
 *
 * Embedding is a protocol with two sides and this host only ever performed
 * one of them: it handed the plug-in a window id and assumed a picture would
 * appear in it. For most plug-ins one side is enough, because they map their
 * own window and draw. For a plug-in that speaks XEmbed properly it is not:
 * it creates its window *unmapped*, announces itself with an _XEMBED_INFO
 * property, and waits for the embedder to send XEMBED_EMBEDDED_NOTIFY before
 * it does anything at all. Nothing here ever sent one, so it waited for ever.
 *
 * From the outside that is the worst kind of bug. The host reports "embedded
 * as a child of window 0x... (712x350)", the plug-in agrees about the size,
 * the parameters are all there, and the pane is empty.
 *
 * So do the embedder's job: notify, activate, focus, and map. All four are
 * harmless to a plug-in that was not waiting for them -- an unsolicited
 * _XEMBED message to a window that does not handle it is discarded, and
 * mapping a mapped window is not a change. That is what makes this safe to
 * do for every native plug-in rather than only the ones known to need it.
 *
 * A separate connection, because this runs on whichever thread opened the
 * editor; closed again immediately. */
