%description
Audio plug-ins built for Windows, macOS and Linux, loaded and run as native
code on Linux. Not emulation and not Wine: a PE loader with a Win32 subsystem
underneath it, a Mach-O loader with an Objective-C runtime and a software Metal
rasteriser, and a CFM/PEF interpreter for Classic Mac OS -- six hosts sharing
one set of shims.

Three windows are included. pestudio (Qt6) is a plug-in browser and player: pick
a folder, pick a plug-in, and get its programs, every exposed parameter, a
playable keyboard, a pitch wheel, patch banks, a recorder, and the plug-in's
own editor -- blitted for Windows plug-ins, embedded as an X11 child window for
native Linux ones. studio is the same host in a session window: a tab per
plug-in beside the pattern tracker's tab, and studiogtk is that session
window in GTK. dwstudio (GTK4) drives the
reimplemented engines: a Korg DW-8000, a 4-op FM synth, a Juno-6 and sample
kits.

The command line has the same hosts: va peload inspects and renders a plug-in
without a window, and va play runs the DW-8000 engine with no plug-in loaded at
all.

This package hosts 64-bit plug-ins. The i386 loader is not built here, as it
needs a 32-bit toolchain and 32-bit FreeType, X11, ALSA and PipeWire; build
from source for 32-bit Windows plug-ins. No plug-in binaries are included --
the plug-ins these hosts load are their authors' own.

# Three build systems in one tree: c/ is a plain Makefile, and peload/, gui/

# which assumes one per tree.
#
# `va` is compiled knowing where it was installed, which is what lets it find
# its helpers with no source tree above it -- see locate_tree() in c/src/dw.c.

%changelog
* Mon Sep 07 2026 Connor McRann <cmcrann@protonmail.com> - 0.3.0-1
- Send MIDI as well as receive it. Both windows carry an out port that was
  created and never written to; everything played locally now goes out of it,
  thru echoes what arrives, and a sequencer's clock drives the transport, so a
  tracker at the other end can play these and be played by them.
- Reach the plug-in with raw MIDI: wheels, pedals, aftertouch and song position
  arrive unchanged, where before only notes, bend and all-notes-off did.
- Give dwstudio the inputs pestudio had -- an audio device chooser, an "is
  anything arriving" line, the input-channel mask, and the same four effect
  input sources -- so the two windows answer the same questions the same way.
- Drive either window from the keyboard: shortcuts for the plug-in list, the
  programs, the editor, rescan, thru, panic and the volume, all on the menus
  they belong to.
- Drop the Engines/Plug-ins switcher: hosting plug-ins is what this is for, and
  the built-in engines stay as what sounds when nothing is loaded.
- Play the computer keyboard while a plug-in's editor has focus, instead of the
  keys going dead the moment a knob is touched.
- Report a fault instead of dying quietly: the failing address is named from the
  symbol table or the import table, the instruction bytes are dumped, a guest
  stack overflow is recognised as one, and a sampling profiler says which stub a
  slow load is sitting in.
- Resolve 7223 ordinal imports by number, and answer the Win32, GDI+ and CRT
  calls the corpus was measured making rather than the ones its import tables
  list.
- Recover a dead 32-bit bridge or out-of-process host rather than leaving a
  window that has quietly stopped working.
* Wed Sep 02 2026 Connor McRann <cmcrann@protonmail.com> - 0.2.0-1
- Host macOS VST3 plug-ins, which never loaded before: the bundle search only
  knew the Windows and Linux layouts, and there was no path that took a Mach-O
  image. All 18 in the test corpus render and drive their own editors.
- Draw and operate macOS editors. The Objective-C runtime was not told about a
  plug-in's own classes, Quartz drew no paths, and frames arrived upside down;
  12 editors that showed nothing now work. macOS VST2 goes from 19 to 31
  rendering, 30 with a working GUI.
- Load the eight Audio Damage Audio Units that are Symbiosis wrappers as the
  VST2 they contain, rather than failing them. 41 of 50 Audio Units render.
- Offer macOS VST2 and VST3 in both windows by default. Audio Units are behind
  -DPESTUDIO_AU=1 / -DPLUGVIEW_AU=1, since each duplicates a .vst beside it.
- Add macfont.h and png_in.h to the source package. Both were #included by the
  build and had never been committed, so only a working copy could compile.
- Stop staging the built launcher into the source tarball, which build-rpm.sh
  had kept doing under the launcher's old name.

* Mon Aug 31 2026 Connor McRann <cmcrann@protonmail.com> - 0.1.1-1
- Fix both desktop entries, which named the launcher by its old name and so
  failed to start either window from the desktop menu.
- Follow the same rename through the man pages, the package descriptions and
  va's own usage text.
- Stamp the About boxes with the version the package is built as, rather than
  the one written into the CMake files.

* Sat Aug 29 2026 Connor McRann <cmcrann@protonmail.com> - 0.1.0-1
- Initial release.
