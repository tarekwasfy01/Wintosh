/* A minimal Objective-C runtime for Mach-O plugins.
 *
 * Cocoa cannot be cloned -- AppKit, CoreGraphics and Metal are closed. But the
 * *runtime* is just a dispatch mechanism over layouts that are documented ABI,
 * and the classes a plugin references have to be ours in any case. So this
 * implements the runtime and stands in for the Apple classes, the same way
 * win32gui.h stands in for GDI on the Windows side.
 *
 * Two decisions make it small:
 *
 *  - SEL is the selector's name string. In a compiled image a method_t.name and
 *    each __objc_selrefs entry already point at the name in __TEXT,__objc_methname;
 *    Apple's runtime later replaces them with uniqued pointers, but nothing
 *    requires that. Leaving them as strings means no fixup pass and lookup is a
 *    name comparison.
 *
 *  - An unrealized class's `bits` field points straight at its class_ro_t, which
 *    is what a statically compiled class in a binary contains. Reading that
 *    directly avoids implementing class realization at all.
 *
 * What this does NOT do is make a GUI work. Once the image binds, the plugin
 * starts sending messages, and every selector it sends needs an implementation
 * behind it. Unknown selectors are logged rather than guessed at, which is how
 * the list of what to implement next gets discovered.

/* Every object begins with its class pointer, and nothing else -- the refcount

 *
 * Apple's runtime keeps the count in the isa's spare bits or in a side table. A
 * plain `long refs` after the isa looks harmless until a plugin subclasses
 * NSObject, because the compiler puts that subclass's first ivar at offset 8 --
 * exactly where such a refcount would sit. nanovg's MNVGcontext keeps its Metal
 * command buffer there, so every retain of the context incremented the stored
 * command-buffer pointer by one, and the next message went to a misaligned
 * address. The same collision cost an NSView its text field (see macns.c).
 *
 * So the count goes in front of the object, behind a magic word marking the
 * allocation as ours. Class objects, constant CFStrings and anything else we did
 * not allocate have no such header and are treated as immortal, which is the
 * right answer for them anyway.
 *
 * Reaching zero retires an object but does not free it. There are no autorelease
 * pools here and no weak references, so the retain/release traffic a plugin emits
 * cannot be balanced faithfully -- and an over-release then hands the allocator a
 * block that is still in use, which surfaces much later as a garbage isa. nanovg's
 * completion handler did exactly that. Retiring instead of freeing turns an
 * unbalanced release into a no-op rather than a corrupted heap; the cost is that a
 * plugin's objects accumulate for as long as its editor is open. */

 * through a pointer this runtime did not make, and it is asked constantly:
 * every retain, every release, every ARC helper.
 *
 * A plugin supplies pointers we did not make all the time, and legitimately.
 * dispatch objects are Objective-C objects on macOS, so ARC emits
 * objc_retainAutoreleasedReturnValue on a dispatch_semaphore_t -- and this
 * host's semaphores are a plain struct with nothing in front of them.
 * AddressSanitizer caught it reading sixteen bytes before one.
 *
 * So the same answer as the CoreFoundation side: a hash set of what we
 * allocated, keyed by address, with the link stored in the prefix so there is
 * nothing extra to allocate. An entry is removed when the object is retired,
 * which is also exactly when obj_pre should start saying no.
 *
 * Locked, because a plugin's dispatched blocks run on threads of their own and
 * allocate objects there -- see gcd_async. The bucket count is generous so the
 * chains stay at one or two entries and the lock is held for a handful of
