"""Everything in this tree that can be checked without a plug-in corpus.

The rendering tests need plug-in binaries, which are not ours to ship and are
not here -- packaging/debian/rules says as much where it skips dh_auto_test.
What is left is still worth guarding, and it is where the expensive bugs have
actually been:

  * the i386 ABI surface, where a wrong calling convention or a Windows type
    declared at the wrong width corrupts a guest's stack silently, only at
    32-bit, and shows up later as "that plug-in crashes" rather than as
    anything pointing back here;
  * the packaging recipes, where a list that has drifted out of step fails the
    build on someone else's machine instead of on ours.

Every check below exists because something in one of those two families
actually broke. Each one names what it would have caught.

    python3 tools/regress.py [--no-build] [--keep] [--list] [--only a,b]

--no-build reuses peload/build instead of configuring a fresh tree, which is
much faster but only checks what that tree happens to have been built from.
--keep leaves the temporary build directories behind for inspection. --only
runs just the named checks, which is how a single one is exercised against a
deliberately broken tree to confirm it still catches what it claims to.

A check that needs something this machine does not have -- a -m32 toolchain,
mingw-w64's i686 import libraries, desktop-file-utils -- reports SKIP and says
why, rather than passing quietly. Exit status is the number of failures.
