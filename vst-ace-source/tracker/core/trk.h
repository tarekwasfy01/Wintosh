/* tracker -- a pattern sequencer that plays other programs over MIDI.
 *
 * Open a vst-ace window per instrument, give each track of the tracker one of
 * them as its destination, and the tracker plays them all: every track is its
 * own ALSA sequencer port, connected to whatever that track names, and a
 * separate clock port drives tempo-synced plug-ins. A track can instead play
 * a sample set -- a folder of WAVs, a note each -- which the tracker sounds
 * itself.
 *
 * This is the whole of it apart from the drawing. The Qt and GTK windows are
 * thin -- they translate keys into trk_key() calls and paint what
 * trk_cell_text() says -- so the two can never disagree about what a key does
 * or what a song file means.
 *
 * Threading: the engine runs its own scheduling thread. Anything that reads
 * or writes the song from another thread holds trk_lock() around it; the
 * trk_* calls below that take the engine do their own locking.
