/* ALSA sequencer MIDI in and out for pestudio.
 *
 * Two ports on one client, the same shape the DW-8000 GUI exposes:
 *
 *   "pestudio in"   writable  -- a USB keyboard or another app (Furnace,
 *                                Schism, a DAW) connects here and plays us
 *   "pestudio out"  readable  -- everything played locally (on-screen piano,
 *                                computer keyboard, incoming MIDI if thru is
 *                                on) is echoed here, so pestudio can drive
 *                                hardware or another synth
 *
 * Input is event-driven: ALSA hands us poll descriptors and a QSocketNotifier
 * sits on each, so events arrive through the Qt event loop as they happen
 * rather than waiting on a polling interval. */
