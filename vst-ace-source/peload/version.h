/* What this build is, for the About boxes and anything else that has to say so.
 *
 * The three values are supplied by CMake. The defaults below are what a
 * compile outside the build system gets, so nothing fails to build without
 * them -- it just cannot claim to know.
 *
 * The date comes from SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH when the environment sets one, which
 * is what Debian's and Fedora's build tooling does to keep packages
 * reproducible: two builds of the same source then produce byte-identical
 * binaries rather than differing in a string nobody reads. __DATE__ would have
 * been simpler and would have broken exactly that. */
