/* vstdirs -- the plug-in folders the user has set, kept where both windows
 * can see them.
 *
 * pestudio and dwstudio browse the same machine, so "where are my plug-ins"
 * has to have one answer: a folder added in the Qt window is one the GTK
 * window searches too, and neither of them is the authoritative copy. That is
 * what this file is -- one list, on disk, that both read at startup and both
 * write when the user changes it.
 *
 * Each folder carries the platform it holds, so a Windows corpus, a Linux one
 * and a macOS one are three separate entries rather than one undifferentiated
 * pile -- which is how people keep them, and how the tree here is laid out
 * (windows/VST2-64, linux/extracted, macos/VST2).
 *
 * That tag says what the folder is *for*. It does not decide what anything in
 * it is: every plug-in is sniffed when it is scanned, and its own binary
 * settles which loader runs it and which platform the browser files it under.
 * A Windows .dll dropped in the Linux folder is still listed as Windows. The
 * tag is there so the settings list is legible and so a folder can be added or
 * dropped a platform at a time; VSTDIRS_ANY is for a folder holding a mix, or
 * one the user did not care to label.
 *
 * The corpora found by walking up from the binary, and the system VST
 * directories, are *not* in here. Those are discovered every run and would
 * only go stale if written down; this is the list of places the user has
 * pointed us at, which is exactly the part a program cannot work out for
 * itself.
 *
 * Format: one folder per line, "<platform>\t<path>", '#' starting a comment,
 * blanks ignored. A line with no tab is read as VSTDIRS_ANY, which is what an
 * older version of this file wrote. Plain text rather than a settings database
 * because the thing it holds is a handful of paths, and being able to fix it
 * in an editor -- or see at a glance what a broken install is searching -- is
 * worth more here than any structure. */
