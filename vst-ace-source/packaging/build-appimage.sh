#
# build-appimage.sh VERSION -- build the vst-ace AppImage: one file, no install,
# every distribution.
#
#   bash packaging/build-appimage.sh 0.3.0
#
# It lands in release/, like the other three.
#
# BUILD ON THE OLDEST TARGET.
#
# An AppImage carries its libraries and borrows the host's glibc, which is the
# one thing it cannot bundle. glibc is backward compatible and not forward
# compatible, so the file runs on the build machine's release and everything
# newer, and on nothing older. Built here on Arch it wants glibc 2.43 and runs
# almost nowhere; built on the ubuntu24.04 VM it wants 2.39 and runs on Ubuntu
# 24.04, Debian 13, Fedora 40 and Arch alike -- the same audience as the three
# packages, plus every distribution none of them targets. Build it there.
#
# What it does not carry:
#
#   peload32 is in the AppImage and needs an i386 glibc, X11 and FreeType on
#   the host, which an AppImage cannot supply: a 32-bit ELF asks the host for
#   /lib/ld-linux.so.2 before anything in here gets a say. It works where those
#   are installed and reports itself unavailable where they are not, which is
#   what the .deb does with its Suggests.
#
#   The runtime/ and runtime32/ directories are inside a read-only image, so
#   the Microsoft DLLs a few plug-ins want cannot be dropped in beside them.
#   PELOAD_DLL_PATH is the way in; the README in there says so.
#
# Needs: everything install-deps.sh installs, plus linuxdeploy, its Qt and GTK
# plugins and appimagetool. Those four are fetched from their release pages
# into ~/.cache/vst-ace/appimage-tools on first use, or taken from
# $VSTACE_APPIMAGE_TOOLS if you would rather supply them yourself.
