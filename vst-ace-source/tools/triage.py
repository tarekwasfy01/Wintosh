"""Load a directory of plug-ins and rank what the failures have in common.

One plug-in that will not load tells you very little: the backtrace lands in
guest code, and the reason is usually an import that quietly resolved to the
generic stub thousands of instructions earlier. A corpus tells you much more,
because the imports that only the *failing* plug-ins need are a short list, and
that list is the work queue.

So this runs the loader over every plug-in it finds, records how each one ended,
and collects every "unknown stdcall arity" line the loader emits -- each of
which names an import that got the generic stub, meaning it returns 0 and, at
i386, pops nothing. It then ranks those imports by how many *failing* plug-ins
import them, which is the order worth fixing them in. An import that fifty
working plug-ins also use is not what broke the other five.

Written for the 32-bit loader, where a wrong stub is fatal rather than merely
wrong, but --loader takes the 64-bit peload just as well.

# The i386 loader prints "unknown stdcall arity" at bind time for every import
# that got the generic stub -- a static fact about the image, available without
# the code ever running. Both loaders print a bare "[stub] dll!sym" the first
# time such a stub is actually *called*, which is much stronger evidence: it
# says this plug-in really did reach for that symbol on this path.
#
# Matching only the first line made this tool blind on x86-64, which never
# prints it: the loader was reporting "no imports fell through to the generic
# stub" for a corpus in which Kontakt was reaching twenty of them.
