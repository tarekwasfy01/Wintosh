/* Protocol between pehost (64-bit) and peload32 --serve (32-bit).
 *
 * A process cannot execute both widths, so a 32-bit plugin has to live in
 * another process. This is the contract between the two, and it is shared
 * source: both sides compile this same header, one at -m64 and one at -m32.
 * Everything crossing the boundary therefore uses fixed-width types and
 * explicit padding -- no pointers, no long, no enums in structs.
 *
 * Two channels, split by who is waiting on them:
 *
 *   control    a UNIX socket carrying request/response for everything the GUI
 *              thread asks: names, counts, program changes, editor open. Each
 *              request gets exactly one reply, so the socket stays in step.
 *
 *   shared     an mmap'd region carrying the things that must not go through a
 *              socket: the audio block (the realtime thread cannot afford a
 *              round trip through the kernel's socket buffers), the editor's
 *              framebuffer (megabytes per frame), and two lock-free rings for
 *              parameter and MIDI writes that the audio side drains.
 *
 * The audio handshake is a pair of POSIX semaphores in the shared region. The
 * host fills `in`, posts `req`, and waits on `done` with a timeout; the helper's
 * worker waits on `req`, calls the plugin, and posts `done`. If the helper dies
 * or stalls, the host's wait times out and it emits silence rather than blocking
 * the whole PipeWire graph.

 * can produce without being held up by a preempted GUI thread).
