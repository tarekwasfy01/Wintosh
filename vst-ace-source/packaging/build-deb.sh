#
# build-deb.sh VERSION -- build the vst-ace .deb for Debian/Ubuntu.
#
# Targets Ubuntu 24.04 and Debian 13 (Trixie) and newer, which is where Qt 6
# and GTK 4 are recent enough for both windows. One package serves both: the
# Qt dependencies are declared as alternatives in debian/shlibs.local, because
# the two distributions do not agree on which runtime packages carry Ubuntu's
# "t64" suffix and dpkg-shlibdeps can only see the one it builds on.
# Run it from anywhere:
#
#   bash packaging/build-deb.sh 0.1.0
#
# The .deb lands in release/. Build-dependencies are listed in
# packaging/debian/control; `sudo apt build-dep .` installs them from a
# checkout, or install them by name:
#
#   sudo apt install build-essential debhelper devscripts dpkg-dev cmake \
#       pkg-config libgtk-4-dev qt6-base-dev libasound2-dev \
#       libpipewire-0.3-dev libx11-dev libcairo2-dev libfreetype-dev

# peload32 is no longer a package of its own.
#
# It was one because dpkg's architecture model says an i386 binary belongs in
# an i386 package, and debhelper will not cross-build one from an amd64 host,
# so this script assembled it by hand. Correct, and it meant 32-bit support
# only arrived for users who knew to install a second thing.
#
# debian/rules installs it into the main package instead. The cost to a
# 64-bit-only user is 250 KB that never executes; the i386 libraries are
# Suggests rather than Depends, so the package still installs on a host with
# no foreign architecture enabled, and peload32 decides at run time whether it
# can actually start rather than assuming it can.
