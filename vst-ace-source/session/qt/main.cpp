/* studio -- the session shell: one window, a tab per synth plug-in, one tab
 * for the tracker.
 *
 * pestudio hosts one plug-in per window; studio is the same host several times
 * over under one roof, beside the tracker, so a song and the instruments it
 * plays live in one window. The tabs do the work: a synth tab is a HostWidget
 * (peload/qtgui/hostwindow.h) and the tracker tab is a TrackerWidget
 * (tracker/qt/trackerwidget.h). This file is only what both ask a frame for --
 * a menu bar, a status line, tab bookkeeping, and a say over which tab's piano
 * answers the computer keyboard.
 *
 * And the routing: every synth tab is registered with the tracker's engine as
 * an in-process MIDI sink (trk_add_sink), named by its plug-in, so a track can
 * play a tab directly -- the track's destination list shows it as "this
 * window: <name>" beside the ALSA windows, and picking it moves the track,
 * exactly as moving it to another window does. Delivery is sample-accurate:
 * the engine's delivery thread hands each tab's Engine wall-clock-stamped
 * blocks (sinkDeliver), and the Engine places every event in its own rendered
 * block on the sample (Engine::injectMidi). A tab closing unregisters its
 * sink first -- trk_remove_sink waits out any delivery in flight -- so the
 * tracker never calls into a dead engine, and tracks routed there fall back
 * to the ALSA windows their songs name.
 *
 * Two more things a frame owes several tabs rather than one. A plug-in whose
 * helper died for good -- its HostWidget restarted it three times and gave up
 * -- is marked on its tab by the shell's watchdog, and File > Reload plug-in
 * is the way back; the recoverable deaths never reach here, HostWidget
 * restarts those itself and says so on the status line. And the whole session
 * -- the open tabs with their plug-ins and sounds, the song, which tracks
 * play which tab -- is one JSON file (session/sessfile.h), written from
 * File > Save session and read back by File > Open session or --session. */
