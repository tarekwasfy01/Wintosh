/* The engine: ALSA sequencer ports, a queue, and a thread that keeps a short
 * stretch of the song scheduled ahead of the queue.
 *
 * Every event goes out timestamped on the queue rather than at the moment a
 * thread gets round to it, so the kernel does the timing: a window busy
 * drawing, or this process being descheduled for a few milliseconds, moves
 * nothing. The thread only has to stay ahead -- it wakes every few
 * milliseconds and tops the schedule up to LOOKAHEAD_S in front of the queue.
 * The window is short so that an edit just ahead of the play position is
 * still heard.
 *
 * Stuck notes are the failure that matters, so every note this program starts
 * is remembered -- per track, per channel -- until a release has been sent
 * for it directly, outside the queue. Stop, routing a track elsewhere, panic
 * and closing all send those, whatever was scheduled and then thrown away.
 *
 * A track can play a sample set instead of a window: a folder of WAVs, each
 * on a note, as its kit.txt says or from C-4 up. Its hits go on the same
 * queue clock as everything else, into a list the audio thread reads: each
 * period it works out when every pending hit falls -- the queue's tick turned
 * into wall time, plus the output's own latency -- and starts it at that
 * sample. So samples keep time with the MIDI tracks to within the queue
 * timer's millisecond, with nothing in between.
 *
 * A track can also play an in-process sink -- a synth this same program
 * hosts -- instead of an ALSA window. Those events take the same route the
 * sample hits do: queued against the tick clock by the scheduling thread,
 * then a delivery thread turns tick into wall time exactly as the queue's
 * timestamps mean it and hands each sink a block at a time, every event with
 * its sample offset in the block. The sink's host places the events in its
 * own rendered block from there, which is the accuracy the kernel's queue
 * gives an ALSA window, without the trip through it. */
