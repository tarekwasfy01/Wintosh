/* The 64-bit bridge server: host one plugin on behalf of another process.
 *
 * peload32 --serve exists because a 32-bit plugin cannot share an address space
 * with a 64-bit host. This exists for a different reason: crash isolation. A
 * plugin that faults takes its process down, and three in this corpus do --
 * TAL-U-No-62 during render, Ragnarok and OB-Xf during load. In-process there is
 * nothing to be done about that; behind the bridge the host loses a helper and
 * emits silence instead of dying.
 *
 * Much shorter than serve32.h, because it drives pehost rather than the VST2 ABI
 * directly -- so it serves Windows VST2, Windows VST3, native Linux VST3, macOS
 * VST2 and Audio Units without knowing which it has.
