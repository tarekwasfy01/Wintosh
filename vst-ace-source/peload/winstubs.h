/* ---- the allocator every plug-in-facing malloc goes through -------------
 *
 * A plug-in frees things. Sometimes it frees something it never got from us, or
 * frees it twice, and until now that reached glibc's free() directly: a wild
 * pointer took the host down, and a plausible-but-wrong one quietly corrupted
 * the heap. The second is much worse. It cost a long chase -- an MFC editor
 * faulting inside its own CMapPtrToPtr::Lookup on a bucket array full of small
 * integers, several subsystems away from whatever had scribbled on it.
 *
 * So every block handed to a plug-in is recorded, and every free asks whether
 * this is one of them.
 *
 * A header in front of the block was the obvious way to do that and is wrong:
 * validating a foreign pointer then means reading the sixteen bytes before it,
 * which is out of bounds by definition. ASan says so immediately, and a pointer
 * that happens to sit at the start of a page says so with the fault this exists
 * to prevent. A side table never touches memory it does not own, and it keeps
 * the pointers we hand out as ordinary malloc pointers -- so host code that
 * frees one directly still works.
 *
 * All the families share the table deliberately. On Windows malloc *is*
 * HeapAlloc on the process heap, so a plug-in may legally allocate with one and
 * free with another; separate bookkeeping per family would break exactly the
 * mixing that works on the real thing. The same goes for every stub that hands
 * back a buffer the caller frees -- FormatMessage, _wcsdup, _Getdays -- which
 * must allocate here rather than with malloc.
 *
 * Removal happens before the free, which is what catches a double free: the
 * second one no longer finds the pointer. Refusing it leaks rather than
 * corrupting, and a leak is something a host survives. */

 * exception whose text says nothing about a missing DLL. On Windows the file is
 * always there, so answering "no such library" is the wrong answer to give.

 * decision: a library is present-and-empty when finding it costs nothing, and
 * absent when finding it would send a plug-in down a road this host cannot
 * take it down.
 *
 * GetProcAddress against one of these still returns NULL for *everything*,
 * implemented or not: the name search it falls back to runs over g_sysdlls
 * alone. That is the right answer only while this list holds nothing that is
 * implemented, which is why the regress check `dll-reachable` enforces exactly
 * that -- a DLL that gains a stub entry has to move to g_sysdlls or the entry
 * is dead code. gdiplus sat here with ninety Gdip* functions behind it, and
 * ws2_32 was in neither list, so LoadLibrary could not even open it. The graphics DLLs are deliberately absent: a plug-in that

 *
 * A stub returning 0 is not a soft failure. The compiler emits a null check
 * only where the source says the cast might fail; a cast the programmer knows
 * cannot fail is used immediately, so a stub turns every one of them into a
 * null dereference somewhere else entirely. That is exactly how it presented:
 * a VST3 plug-in faulted reading address 0x3c8, which is `lea rcx,[rax+0x3c8]`
 * on a NULL rax two instructions after the call, while the *next* block in the
 * same function tested for null before using the same pointer.
 *
 * MSVC records the whole class hierarchy in the image, so this is a lookup
 * rather than a guess. The object's vftable is preceded by a pointer to a
 * CompleteObjectLocator, which names the type, says where this subobject sits
 * inside the complete object, and points at a hierarchy descriptor listing
 * every base. Walk the bases for one whose mangled name matches the target and
 * the cast is that base's address; find none and the cast genuinely fails.
 *
 * Types are compared by mangled name rather than by TypeDescriptor address: a
 * class defined in two images has two descriptors, and comparing addresses
 * would refuse a cast that must succeed. Names are what MSVC's own runtime
 * compares for the same reason. */

 * nothing. That is exactly how it turned up -- a SynthEdit VST3 read its module
 * graph out of XML, every module id came back unset, and the registry lookup
 * returned null to a call site with no null check.
 *
 * Windows `long` is 32 bits at both widths while the host's is 64 at one of

 * a calling convention, which is the whole reason they are spelled differently
 * here -- and getting that wrong is silent at x86-64 and fatal at i386.
 *
 * wsprintfA/W are WINAPIV: the one cdecl pair in an otherwise stdcall DLL,
 * because a stdcall callee cannot pop an argument list it has no way to count.
 * A cdecl export carries no @N, so gen_arity.py finds nothing to record and
 * win32_arity.h has no entry for either -- which is why the loader says
 * "unknown stdcall arity, assuming 0" when a plugin imports one. Assuming 0
 * happens to be right for cdecl, since the caller cleans up, so the stack
 * survives; what does not survive is the call returning 0 with nothing
 * written, leaving the caller to use a buffer it believes was filled.
 *
 * wvsprintfA/W take the whole argument list as one va_list parameter, so there
 * is nothing variadic left to count and they are ordinary WINAPI stdcall.
 * win32_arity.h has them at 12 bytes -- three arguments -- and that is the
 * authority to follow: a cdecl stub here returns without popping them, so at
 * i386 the plugin's ESP is left 12 bytes low on every call and its stack is
 * wrong from that point on. MS, not MSCRT, for these two.
 *
 * The 1024 cap is the documented contract, not a shortcut: Windows refuses to
 * write more than 1024 bytes (or wide characters) here regardless of how big
 * the caller's buffer is, and callers size their buffers knowing that. */

 * table can be read and checked against the documentation. An id not in it gets
 * the same answer an unknown CSIDL gets -- the roaming application data folder
 * -- because a plausible directory is what every caller of this can proceed
 * with, and a refusal is what none of them can.

 * that frame is dead the moment the stub returns; the return address it saved
 * lives in stack the guest has since reused for its own calls. longjmp would
 * then resume through whatever overwrote it.
 *
 * What must be captured instead is the state at the stub's entry, which is the
 * guest's: the caller's stack pointer, the return address, and the Microsoft
 * callee-saved set -- rbx, rbp, rdi, rsi, r12-r15 and xmm6-xmm15. Note that rdi,
 * rsi and the upper xmm registers are callee-saved on Windows but *not* in the
 * System V convention, so a host longjmp would not restore them even if the
 * frame survived.
 *
 * The layout below is private to this pair. MSVC's jmp_buf is 256 bytes on
 * x86-64 and 64 on i386, both of which leave room. */

/* Every MSVC vintage ships the same CRT surface under its own DLL name --

 * stub registered once against msvcrt.dll answers for all of them. Matching
 * the literal name instead would need a fresh copy of the table per vintage. */
/* Every spelling of the C runtime resolves to the one implementation here.
 *
 * The 2015 toolchain split the CRT into fifteen apiset DLLs --
 * api-ms-win-crt-runtime-l1-1-0.dll, -stdio-, -heap-, -math- and so on -- each
 * a forwarder onto ucrtbase. A plug-in built with MSVC 2015 or later imports
 * every CRT function through those names rather than through msvcrt.dll, so
 * without them here the whole C runtime missed the table and fell through to
 * the generic do-nothing stub.
 *
 * The one that made it fatal rather than merely wrong is _initterm_e. It walks
 * an array of initialiser function pointers and calls each one, which is how a
 * C++ module runs its static constructors; stubbed out, it returns success
 * having run none of them. A side-loaded MSVCP140 therefore mapped, reported
 * that it had initialised, and left every locale and iostream global null --
 * and the plug-in that went on to use one faulted a long way from the cause.
 * The implementation was already here and registered under msvcrt.dll; only
 * the name was missing.
 *
 * Prefix rather than exact match: the apiset names carry a version suffix that
 * changes between Windows releases (-l1-1-0 today), and the import table's copy
 * is truncated by some plug-ins besides. */

 * -- up to twenty-four times for a single miss. A packed plug-in rebuilds its
 * whole import table that way. Chord Organ made 7,565 lookups and twelve
 * million string comparisons doing it.
 *
 * The table is constant, so it is indexed once and searched by halves after
 * that. The order is (library case-insensitively, then symbol exactly), which
 * is the comparison the scan made, and ties break on the original table
 * position -- so where the same name is registered twice, the binary search
