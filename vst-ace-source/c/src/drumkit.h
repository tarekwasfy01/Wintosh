/* Sample-playback drum engine.
 *
 * A kit is a directory of WAV files. Which note plays which file is said by a
 * kit.txt in that directory, when there is one:
 *
 *   # pad <note> [gain <dB>] [choke <group>] file <name.wav>
 *   pad C-4 file Kick 32.wav
 *   pad F#2 choke 1 file Hat closed.wav
 *   pad A#2 choke 1 gain -3 file Hat open.wav
 *
 * Notes are written as the tracker writes them (C-4 is MIDI 60) or as MIDI
 * numbers; under C-0 the octave goes negative (C--1 is MIDI 0). Pads in one
 * choke group cut each other off, the way a closed hi-hat stops an open one.
 * The file name is the rest of the line, spaces and all. Without a kit.txt --
 * or with one that names not one pad -- every .wav is a pad, sorted by name,
 * on consecutive notes from DK_BASE_NOTE up -- C-4, where a tracker's keys
 * start -- or from low enough for them all to fit, in a set of more than 68.
 * drumkit_write_map writes exactly that mapping out as a kit.txt to start
 * from.
 *
 * Samples are stereo, and resampled on the fly to the engine rate, which
 * matters because sample libraries are mostly 44.1 kHz while the engines here
 * run at 48 kHz.
 *
 * Unlike the other three engines nothing here is reverse engineered: it plays
 * whatever WAVs you point it at. */
