/* patch -- plugin patches as JSON, singly or as a bank.
 *
 * The format is the plugin's own vocabulary: parameter *names* exactly as the
 * plugin reports them, values in the 0..1 the VST APIs use.
 *
 *   {
 *     "plugin":     "FB-7999",
 *     "uniqueID":   "0x66623739",
 *     "pluginPath": "../windows/VST2-64/fb799964.dll",
 *     "patches": [
 *       { "name": "cursor",  "program": 0, "params": { "VCF Cutoff": 0.61 } },
 *       { "name": "confirm", "params": { "VCF Cutoff": 0.80 } }
 *     ]
 *   }
 *
 * A file holding one patch writes "program" and "params" at the top level with
 * no "patches" array; it reads back as a bank of one, so callers handle a single
 * patch and a bank of forty through the same path.
 *
 * Keying on names rather than indices is what makes a patch readable, diffable
 * and hand-editable, and it survives a plugin being rebuilt with a parameter
 * inserted in the middle -- which an index-keyed file would not.
 *
 * A key that is all digits is taken as a parameter index, which covers the two
 * cases a name cannot: a parameter the plugin leaves unnamed, and several
 * parameters sharing one name (common -- FB-3300 does it for 183 of its 233).
 * Names are resolved first, so a plugin with a parameter genuinely called "12"
 * still wins.
 *
 * "plugin" and "uniqueID" are advisory, recorded so that applying a patch to
 * the wrong plugin can say so rather than silently scattering values across
 * unrelated parameters. "pluginPath" is what lets a bank name its own synth, so
 * that opening the bank opens the plugin it was written for; it is resolved
 * relative to the bank file, which keeps a bank portable alongside its plugin.
