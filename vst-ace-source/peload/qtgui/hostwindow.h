/* hostwindow -- the per-plug-in half of pestudio, as a widget.
 *
 * Everything pestudio keeps per plug-in lives here: the PipeWire engine, the
 * piano and pitch wheel, the parameter table, the patch banks, the editor
 * hosting (X11 embed and pixel blit), the MIDI wiring, and the browser that
 * finds and loads plug-ins. HostWidget is the window pestudio used to be,
 * minus the QMainWindow frame -- menus and the status bar belong to the
 * shell, which answers through the HostShell interface below. pestudio's
 * shell wraps exactly one of these; the studio window will wrap one per
 * plug-in.
 *
 * Audio runs on PipeWire's own data-loop, which RTKit has already granted
 * realtime priority, so a small quantum does not underrun. The Qt thread never
 * touches the plugin during render -- notes and parameter writes go through
 * pehost's lock-free queue, and swapping plugins parks the stream first. */

/* The sprung wheel a synth keyboard puts to the left of its keys.
 *
 * Sprung is the whole of it. A bend left off centre detunes everything played
 * afterwards, and nothing downstream can tell that the user stopped meaning it,
 * so the wheel returns to centre the moment it is let go and sends that centre --
 * exactly what the hardware does. Panic recentres it for the same reason it
 * releases held notes: a bend stuck at the top is as wrong as a note stuck on,
 * and harder to recognise as the cause, because the plugin goes on sounding
 * correct and merely in the wrong key.
 *
 * The value stays in MIDI's 14-bit form (0..16383, 8192 at rest) rather than
 * being converted to semitones, because how far the wheel reaches is the
 * plugin's business: bend range is a plugin parameter, and converting here would
 * mean guessing it.
 *
 * Dragging is relative to where the wheel was grabbed rather than absolute to
 * the cursor. An absolute mapping snaps to full bend when the wheel is grabbed
 * near an end, and the way to a small bend should not be a large one. */
