/* plugview -- the plug-in half of dwstudio.
 *
 * dwstudio began as a front end for the engines in c/src: it read preset banks
 * out of a plug-in's resources and played them through a reimplementation. It
 * never loaded the plug-in. pestudio, the Qt window, does the opposite -- it
 * runs the real thing through pehost and shows the plug-in's own editor.
 *
 * This is that half, in GTK. It is the same pehost API pestudio drives, so the
 * two windows host identically and differ only in toolkit: pick a directory,
 * pick a plug-in, pick a program, move its parameters, or open the editor the
 * plug-in draws itself.
 *
 * Everything here runs on the GTK thread except plugview_render, which the
 * audio callback owns.
 *
 * All state is per-instance: one plugview is one plug-in pane -- its browser,
 * its loaded plug-in, its editor. dwstudio makes one; a shell hosting several
 * plug-in windows makes one per window. Every entry point takes the instance
 * first. The one exception is the VST3 run-loop hook table, which lives in
 * pehost and is process-global (v3_set_runloop_hooks), so the last pane built
 * is the one native editors register their descriptors and timers with. */
