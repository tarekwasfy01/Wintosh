/* trackerview -- the GTK tracker as one widget a shell can embed.
 *
 * The standalone tracker-gtk wraps this in a window (tracker/gtk/main.c) and
 * nothing here changes for it: no sinks, the window's own title and close
 * flow. A shell -- studiogtk -- makes one of these on the engine it owns,
 * packs trk_view_widget() into a tab, offers its synth tabs as in-process
 * destinations through trk_view_set_sinks(), and closes the tab through
 * trk_view_confirm_close() so an unsaved song is still asked about.
 *
 * Everything runs on the GTK thread. The engine is the caller's: opened
 * before trk_view_new, stopped and closed after the view is freed. */
