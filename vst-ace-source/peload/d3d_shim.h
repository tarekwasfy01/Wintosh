/* Direct3D 11 and Direct2D, far enough for a plug-in to draw with them.
 *
 * A SynthEdit VST3 builds its editor on D3D11: it makes a device, hangs a
 * Direct2D device context off it, and does every bit of its drawing through
 * that context. There is no GPU here and no prospect of one, but the drawing
 * itself is ordinary 2D -- filled rounded rectangles, bitmaps, text -- and the
 * rasteriser written for GDI+ already does all of it.
 *
 * So D3D11 exists here only as far as the plug-in needs to walk through it to
 * reach Direct2D: a device, a DXGI surface standing for the back buffer, and
 * the query-interface chain between them. Everything that would actually touch
 * hardware answers "no". Direct2D is where the work happens, and it renders
 * into the same w32_surf a GDI+ graphics object writes to.
 *
 * Objects reuse the dwprobe machinery from dwrite_shim.h: a full-length vtable
 * of probes, with the slots that matter overwritten. A slot nobody implemented
 * says so under PELOAD_VERBOSE and returns E_NOTIMPL, which is how the list
 * below was arrived at -- run it, read what it asked for, implement that.
