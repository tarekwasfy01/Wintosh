# build-rpm.sh VERSION -- build the vst-ace .rpm for Fedora.
#
# Targets Fedora 40 and newer, which is where Qt 6 and GTK 4 are recent enough
# for both windows. Run it from anywhere:
#
#   bash packaging/build-rpm.sh 0.1.0
#
# The .rpm lands in release/, which is not tracked by git -- publish it on the
# releases page. Build-dependencies come from packaging/install-deps.sh, or by
# name:
#
#   sudo dnf install gcc gcc-c++ make cmake pkgconf-pkg-config rpm-build \
#       rpmdevtools desktop-file-utils gtk4-devel qt6-qtbase-devel \
#       alsa-lib-devel pipewire-devel libX11-devel cairo-devel freetype-devel
