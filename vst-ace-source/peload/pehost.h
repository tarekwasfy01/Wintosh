/* pehost -- host a Windows x86-64 VST2 plugin natively on Linux, no Wine.
 *
 * Wraps the PE loader, the Microsoft-ABI bridge and the Win32 stub layer behind
 * a plain C API so both a CLI renderer and a GUI can drive the same plugin.
 *
 * Threading contract, which follows VST2's own:
 *   - pehost_open/close and the parameter/program calls come from one thread
 *     (the GUI thread).
 *   - pehost_render() is called from the audio thread and nothing else.
 *   - Note events are passed through an internal lock-free queue, so
 *     pehost_note_on/off are safe to call from the GUI thread while the audio
 *     thread renders.
 *
 * Every thread that will touch plugin code must call pehost_thread_init()
 * first: MSVC-generated code reads its TEB through %gs, and that register is
 * set up per thread. */
